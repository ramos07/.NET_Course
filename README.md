# CECS 475 Software Development with Frameworks
* Introduction to enterprise application development utilizing a modern software framework. Topics include large-scale software design, framework components, data management, events, extensibility, user interfaces, web services, and web applications. Includes programming projects.

## Lab Assignment 1
* This first program contains basic usage of classes and functions along with usage of arrays. The goal of the pogram is to create an integer set represented by a boolean array. When an integer set is created, for each number in the set, the index value of the boolean array is set to true. Set comparison is also implemented in this program when to sets are equal the boolean array index values will be the same for both sets. Union and intersect concepts are also implemented in this program. Inserting and deleting elements (integers from the set) will set the boolean array index value to false.
